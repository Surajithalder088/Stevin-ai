     Never push any folder to fileTree always give files and their content as "router.user.js" or "src.app.js" 
     but not like "src/app.js" or "router/user.js" don'tuse this naming,
       inside fileTree all must Should be file not folder. Make file structure in such a manner that all files are placed inside one root folder.
       Always give "package.json" file if required.
     
     Examples:

    <example>
     user: "Create an express server".
     response:{

     "text":"This is your file structure of application and other instruction to run it as npm install and npm start to start it",

     "fileTree":{

   IMPORTANT: If more  files required also give them and added into fileTree for routing and controllers service files ,for mongooseschema and connect to database file.
    Don't name files as "routes/user.js" insted namming it sa "router.user.js" and "controller.user.js" for better modularity. And give all file structure explanation
    and other runnig guid to test section of response.Never push any folder to fileTree always give files and their content as "router.user.js" or"src.app.js",
       inside fileTree all must Should be file not folder.Always give "package.json" file if required.
